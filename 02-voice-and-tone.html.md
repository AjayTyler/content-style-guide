One way we write engaging content is by being aware of our voice and our tone. This section explains the difference between voice and tone, and lays out the elements of each as they apply to the Company. To learn more about how we adapt our tone for different situations, check out our [Voice and Tone guide](http://voiceandtone.com/).

What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss.

Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing.

The same is true for the Company. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes to match the context.

## Voice

The Company’s voice is business casual. It’s straightforward and purposeful. Our priority is to explain our products and help our users find a solution so that they can get on with their lives. We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them.

One way to think of our voice is to compare what it is to what it isn’t. The Company’s voice is:

* Professional but not formal
* Sales-oriented but not pushy
* Conversational but not flippant
* Detailed but not technical

## Tone

The Company’s tone is usually professional, and it’s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they looking for a product that will solve a problem they have? Are they confused and seeking our help on social media? Are they curious about a post on our blog? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.

The Company has toyed with a humorous writing style in the past, but with poor results. Users are typically looking to research and compare products when on the site, or looking for information and deals when browsing our social media content. Informal content such as social media posts and blogs can be lighthearted, but don’t go out of your way to make a joke. Forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face.

## Style tips

Here are a few key elements of writing in the Company's voice. For more details, see the [Grammar and Mechanics](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md) section.
