## Basics

The Company's blog generally publishes:

* Tips and tricks for small businesses
* Examples of how to use products sold by the Company
* Buying guides
* Case studies featuring notable customers
* Feature, release, and integration announcements

We publish blog posts that lead readers to answers for questions they might not have asked yet. We want to show people that we're an industry leader with the best products, and we use our blog to tell the stories behind those products.

## Guidelines

When writing for the blog, follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](/02-voice-and-tone.html.md) and [Grammar and mechanics](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md) sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.

### Be casual, but smart
This isn’t a term paper, so there’s no need to be stuffy. Drop some knowledge while casually engaging your readers with conversational language.

### Be specific
If you're writing about data, put the numbers in context. If you're writing about a notable customer, give the reader plenty of information about the company's stage, workflow, results, and values.

### Get to the point
Get to the important stuff right away, and don’t bury the kicker. Blog posts should be scannable and easy to digest. Break up your paragraphs into short chunks of three or four sentences, and use subheadings. Our users are busy, and we should always keep that in mind.

### Link it up
Feel free to link away from the blog if it helps you explain something.

### Use tags and keywords
In WordPress, add keywords that apply to your article. Look through existing posts for common tags. If you’re not sure if a word should be a tag, it probably shouldn’t.

### Use pictures
Include images in your blog posts when it makes sense. If you’re explaining how to use a product, include images to illustrate your point. Make sure to use alt text.
