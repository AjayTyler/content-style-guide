With every piece of content we publish, we aim to:

* **Educate.** Tell readers what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them the exact information they need, along with opportunities to learn more. Remember that you’re the expert, and readers don’t have access to everything you know.

* **Empower.** Help people understand what they're looking at by using language that informs them and encourages them to make the most of our products.

* **Guide.** Think of yourself as a tour guide for our readers. Whether you’re leading them through the website, blog, or other materials, communicate in a clear and helpful way.

* **Be honest.** Understand the Company's place in our users’ lives. Avoid dramatic storytelling and grandiose claims. Focus on our real strengths.

* **Respect.** Treat readers with the respect they deserve. Put yourself in their shoes, and don’t patronize them. Remember that they have other things to do. Be considerate and inclusive. Don’t market at people; communicate with them.

In order to achieve those goals, we make sure our content is:

* **Clear.** Write to be understood. Research the topic you’re writing about. Use simple words and sentences.

* **Useful.** Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?

* **Professional.** Users are looking for answers, not entertainment. Write to address critical details without becoming overly technical.
